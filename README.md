Plastic Detection in Surroundings using Machine Learning
This project aims to detect plastic waste in environmental images using a machine learning model. It utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, trained on the COCO dataset, to identify and locate plastic objects. The solution is paired with an easy-to-use Gradio UI for real-time image input and result visualization.
